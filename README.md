# QMK Userspace

This QMK Usewrspacve overlay is for my TypeMatrix like BFO-9000 full loadout layout

## Howto configure your build targets

1. Run the normal `qmk setup` procedure if you haven't already done so -- see [QMK Docs](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs) for details.
1. Enable userspace in QMK config using `qmk config user.overlay_dir="$(realpath qmk_userspace)"`
1. Add a new keymap for your board using `qmk new-keymap`
    * This will create a new keymap in the `keyboards` directory, in the same location that would normally be used in the main QMK repository. For example, if you wanted to add a keymap for the Planck, it will be created in `keyboards/planck/keymaps/<your keymap name>`
    * You can also create a new keymap using `qmk new-keymap -kb <your_keyboard> -km <your_keymap>`
    * Alternatively, add your keymap manually by placing it in the location specified above.
    * `layouts/<layout name>/<your keymap name>/keymap.*` is also supported if you prefer the layout system
1. Add your keymap(s) to the build by running `qmk userspace-add -kb <your_keyboard> -km <your_keymap>`
    * This will automatically update your `qmk.json` file
    * Corresponding `qmk userspace-remove -kb <your_keyboard> -km <your_keymap>` will delete it
    * Listing the build targets can be done with `qmk userspace-list`
1. Commit your changes
